Today, I'll introduce two Vim plugins for Markdown.

### Live Preview

The plugin is called [vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown).

You can check example in the below image:

    # gem install redcarpet
    # npm -g intsall instant-markdown-d

### vim-markdown by tpope
To tell the truth, I don't know clearly what this plugin really does. The plugin's description tells that it supports syntax highlighting and filetype plugins. If you know what this plugin does in particular, please let me know.
